## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the project specifications you will be working against during the training week.
This document contains the expectations and requirements for the project.

This project involves the topics covered over the previous weeks.

This project is an individual one designed to check your attained knowledge as well as to challenge you to do additional research to complete the given tasks.

Project domain is the creation of a Lightning Node on a platform Voltage. 
In addition, creating an application that will allow you to interact with the Voltage API as well as your Lighning Node.

Initial application with basic functionality will be provided as well as a demo video explaining how the basic application was built.

Voltage platform gives new users some money to use up for free, as long as you will stop/start your node for when you are working on the project this will not cost you any sats.

## Objective

Basic functionality provided in the application includes:
* Endpoint that return information about the first Lightning Node.
* A simple web page with a button, which when clicked calls the Voltage API and return information about your first Lighning Node and displays it on the web page.

Additional features to implement:
* Better UI for existing information display functionality.
* Ability to stop and start your Lightning Node.
* A search field to check if the provided name is suitable for a new Lightning Node creation.
* Extending UI to display information about all the Lightning Nodes under your account.
* Ability to create a new Lightning Node from the web page.
* Ability to delete a Lightning Node from the web page.

It is not mandatory to implement the objectives in the order they are given.

## Scope

This project is a one week project, with an optional presentation of the final version of the application at the end.

The requirements set for the project are below. 

* A functional application created using Express, following best practices and design principles.
* The application should have a basic front-end website.
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System.

Ask me anything session will be provided to try and answer any questions you might have about the project. 
Additionally, in case of you needing help you can reach out on Discord.

## Constraints
